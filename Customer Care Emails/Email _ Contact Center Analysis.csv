Hello SnowMobile team,

I've been looking at your Frostbite EV model and comparing it with Tesla's offerings. I'm quite interested but have some questions about the tax incentives and financing options available.

I understand there are OZEV grants available, but I'm a bit confused about how these work with your financing packages. Could you explain how these credits would be applied to the purchase price? Also, what documentation would I need to provide to qualify?

I'm based in the Midlands region and wondering if there are any additional local incentives I should be aware of. The Tesla dealer mentioned something about this, but I'd prefer to go with the Frostbite if the numbers work out.

Looking forward to your response,
Theo Jenkins

Dear Theo,

Thank you for your interest in the Frostbite EV. I'd be happy to clarify the tax incentive structure for you.

The OZEV grant currently provides £2,500 off the purchase price, which is automatically deducted at the point of sale. For financing, we can apply this reduction before calculating your monthly payments. You'll just need to provide proof of address and complete a simple eligibility form which we can help you with.

In the Midlands region, you're also eligible for an additional £500 local green vehicle incentive when financing through our preferred partners. I'd be happy to schedule a call to walk you through the complete breakdown of available incentives and our competitive financing rates.

Would you be available for a brief call tomorrow to discuss this in more detail?

Hello SnowMobile team,

I've been researching various trucks and I'm particularly interested in your Tundra Truck model. I currently own a Ford Ranger but I'm looking to upgrade to something with better towing capacity for my horse trailer.

Could you please provide me with the detailed towing specifications for the Tundra? I'd especially like to know how it compares to the Ford Ranger in terms of towing capability.

Also, I noticed you have a dealership in Wales. Would it be possible to arrange a viewing at your Cardiff location?

Thank you for your interest in the SnowMobile Tundra Truck. We'd be delighted to help you find the perfect vehicle for your towing needs.

The Tundra has a maximum towing capacity of 12,000 pounds, which is significantly higher than the Ford Ranger's 7,500-pound capacity. I'll attach our comprehensive comparison sheet that breaks down all the towing specifications in detail.

Our Cardiff dealership would be happy to arrange a viewing for you. We have several Tundra models on display, and our team can demonstrate its towing capabilities firsthand.

From: George Clarke <georgeclarke@email.com>
To: Customer Service <support@snowmobile.com>
Date: April 13, 2025 11:42:22 GMT

Dear SnowMobile Support,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment regarding the exterior finish of my 2023 Polar 4x4, which I purchased just last January. The paint on the roof has started peeling significantly, exposing the bare metal underneath. This is completely unacceptable for a vehicle that's barely 15 months old.

I've been a loyal SnowMobile customer and specifically chose the Polar 4x4 for its supposed premium quality and durability. To see the paint deteriorating so quickly in our Northern Ireland weather is deeply concerning. The peeling is particularly noticeable along the front section of the roof and is spreading towards the middle.

I have two urgent questions:
1. Is this issue covered under the vehicle's warranty?
2. How quickly can someone inspect the vehicle to assess the damage?

This kind of quality issue seriously makes me question the build standards of SnowMobile vehicles. I need this addressed as soon as possible before the exposed metal begins to rust and creates an even bigger problem.

Please respond with available appointment times for an inspection. I expect this to be treated as a priority given the potential for further damage.

Regards,
George Clarke

To whom it may concern,

I am absolutely furious about the state of my Avalanche XTR after your so-called ""professional service"" last week. I specifically brought my snowmobile in for routine maintenance, and now I'm dealing with a massive oil leak that wasn't there before!

This is completely unacceptable. I paid premium prices for the Avalanche XTR just last September, and I've maintained it meticulously. Now, after your service center had their hands on it, I'm finding oil puddles everywhere. The engine is making concerning noises, and I can't even use the vehicle in this condition.

What exactly did your technicians do during the service? How do you plan to fix this immediately? I need this resolved ASAP as I have important trips planned this weekend that I cannot cancel.

I expect an immediate response and solution to this problem. Every minute that passes is causing more damage to my engine, and I hold your service department entirely responsible for this mess.

Dear Ms. Thompson,

Thank you for contacting SnowMobile Customer Service regarding your 2022 Glacier Sedan's brake system.

While some brake noise can be normal, recurring squeaking sounds should be inspected to ensure optimal performance and safety. This could be related to moisture accumulation on the brake rotors or might indicate that your brake pads need attention. Given this is the third occurrence, we recommend bringing your vehicle to our Belfast service center for a thorough inspection.

We can schedule an appointment at your earliest convenience. Our technicians will examine the brake system and provide a detailed assessment of any necessary adjustments or maintenance required.

Thank you for your interest in the Avalanche XTR. As someone based in Scotland, you'll be pleased to know that our vehicle was actually tested extensively in the Scottish Highlands during development.

Regarding your specific questions:

The Avalanche XTR features our patented TerraGrip system, which provides superior traction on steep, rocky terrain. In independent tests, it outperformed the Discovery by 27% in extreme gradient conditions.

Key differentiating features include:
- Advanced terrain response system with 7 modes (vs. Discovery's 5)
- Higher ground clearance (285mm vs. 260mm)
- Superior approach angle of 31° 
- Enhanced undercarriage protection

Would you be interested in scheduling a test drive at our Aberdeen showroom? We currently have an Avalanche XTR available for demonstration on our off-road course.

I'm writing about an ongoing issue with my 2023 Glacier Sedan that I purchased last December. This is actually my third time reaching out about this problem, and frankly, I'm getting quite frustrated.

The wind noise coming through the door seals at highway speeds is becoming unbearable. I specifically chose the Glacier Sedan over a Toyota Corolla because it was marketed as having superior cabin insulation, but the noise level is making my daily commute on the M8 extremely unpleasant.

Could you please arrange for a proper inspection? The last two visits to your Edinburgh service center didn't resolve the issue, and the noise seems to be getting worse, especially during the recent stormy weather we've been having in Scotland.

The AC is barely producing any cold air, even when set to the lowest temperature setting. When I turn it on, I can hear the system running, but the air coming through the vents remains lukewarm at best. This started happening about three days ago, and I'm concerned it might be a serious issue.

Hello SnowMobile Support,

I'm having significant trouble with the roof rack system I purchased for my 2024 Polar 4x4. I've been trying to install it for the past two hours, and something just isn't right. The mounting brackets don't seem to align properly with the roof rails, and I'm worried about damaging either the rack or my vehicle.

I've followed the instruction manual step by step, but there seems to be a gap between the mounting points and the rails that shouldn't be there. Is this normal? The whole system feels loose, which can't be safe for carrying equipment.

Could someone please help me understand what I might be doing wrong? I really need this rack installed before my upcoming trip next weekend. Also, is it possible to schedule an inspection at your service center to ensure it's installed correctly?

I purchased this directly from your dealership in January when I bought my Polar 4x4, and this is the first time I've tried to install it. The quality of the rack itself seems fine, but this installation process is incredibly frustrating.

Looking forward to your guidance on this matter.

I am writing with increasing frustration regarding the ongoing oil consumption issue with my 2022 Tundra Truck, which I purchased from your Belfast dealership last June. This is now the fourth time I'm having to raise this concern, and quite frankly, I'm at my wit's end.

My truck is consuming oil at an alarming rate - nearly 1 litre every 1,000 kilometers. This is absolutely unacceptable for a vehicle that's less than three years old. I've been monitoring this closely since January, and the problem is only getting worse. My brother-in-law, who owns a Ford Ranger, doesn't have to deal with anything like this.

I've already brought this to your attention multiple times over the past few months, but the ""top-ups"" your service department keeps recommending aren't addressing the underlying issue. When I purchased this vehicle, I was assured of its reliability and performance.

Two questions I need answered:
1. When can you perform a proper oil consumption test?
2. What will be done to permanently resolve this issue?

I need this addressed urgently as I rely on this vehicle for my daily work commute. If this continues, I'll have no choice but to explore other options, including legal ones.

Please respond with a concrete action plan.

Dear SnowMobile Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm writing from Cardiff, Wales, and I've been researching electric vehicles with a particular focus on environmental impact. Your Frostbite EV model has caught my attention, and I'm interested in learning more about its ecological footprint.

Could you provide me with detailed information about the Frostbite EV's emissions data and overall environmental impact? I'm currently comparing it with the Nissan Leaf, and I'd like to make an informed decision based on sustainability metrics.

Specifically, I have three questions:
1. What is the total carbon footprint of manufacturing a Frostbite EV?
2. How does your battery recycling program work?
3. What are your projected emissions savings over a 5-year period compared to conventional vehicles?

Thank you for your time. I'm looking forward to learning more about SnowMobile's commitment to environmental sustainability.

Dear SnowMobile Support,

I'm writing about an ongoing issue with my 2022 Blizzard SUV that I purchased from your Belfast dealership in November 2022. For the third time now, I'm experiencing an annoying rattling noise coming from the sunroof area. This started about two months ago, and despite two previous visits to your service center, the problem keeps coming back.

The rattling is most noticeable when driving over bumps or rough roads, and it's becoming increasingly frustrating. I've already had this looked at twice, but whatever fix was applied clearly isn't working long-term.

Could you please advise what can be done to resolve this permanently? I'd like to schedule another inspection, but I want assurance that this time it will be properly diagnosed and fixed.

Dear SnowMobile Service Team,

I'm writing regarding a serious issue with my 2023 Polar 4x4 that I purchased from your Cardiff dealership last August. The windshield wiper system has completely failed during some particularly wet weather we're having in Wales, which as you can imagine, is creating a very dangerous situation.

The wipers started making an unusual grinding noise yesterday, and this morning they stopped working altogether. The motor seems to be completely dead - there's no response when I use the wiper controls, not even a sound. This is especially concerning as I rely on this vehicle for my daily commute through rural areas.

Could you please advise on two things:
1. How quickly can you get me in for an emergency repair?
2. What would be the estimated cost for this type of repair?

I've had the vehicle for less than a year, and I'm quite disappointed to be experiencing such a significant issue already. I need this resolved as soon as possible given the safety implications of driving without functioning wipers in Welsh weather.

Date: April 18, 2025, 18:17:54

Dear SnowMobile Support,

I'm writing regarding an ongoing issue with the auto-parking system in my 2023 Frostbite EV. I purchased the vehicle last February, and until now, it's been relatively reliable. However, the parking assist feature has started acting erratically over the past week.

When I attempt to use the auto-parking function, the system either fails to initiate or stops mid-process. This is particularly frustrating as I specifically chose this model over a Tesla for its advanced parking capabilities. I live in a busy area of Cardiff, and reliable parking assistance is essential for my daily routine.

The system displays a ""Parking Assist Unavailable"" message, but there's no explanation of why. I've already tried resetting the system multiple times as suggested in the manual, but the problem persists.

Could you please advise on how to resolve this issue? I'd appreciate if you could schedule a diagnostic check at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
Isla Lewis

Thank you for contacting SnowMobile Support regarding your Frostbite EV's parking assist system.

In the meantime, please ensure that all parking sensors are clean and free from any debris, as this can sometimes affect system performance.

I am absolutely FURIOUS with this ongoing issue! This is now the FIFTH time I'm writing about the infotainment system in my 2022 Glacier Sedan completely freezing up. I purchased this vehicle in September 2022, and I've been dealing with this nightmare ever since.

The touchscreen keeps freezing at the most inconvenient times - just yesterday, I was trying to navigate to an important meeting in Cardiff, and the entire system locked up. I couldn't access navigation, climate controls, or even the radio! I had to pull over and restart the car THREE times just to get it working again.

Your service center in Wales has been absolutely useless in resolving this. Every time I bring it in, they do a ""system reset"" and tell me it's fixed, but the problem keeps coming back. I'm tired of hearing that ""it's a known issue"" and ""engineering is working on it."" When will there actually be a permanent solution?

Dear SnowMobile Team,

I simply had to write to tell you how absolutely thrilled I am with my new Avalanche XTR. After three months of ownership here in the Scottish Highlands, I can confidently say this is the most capable vehicle I've ever owned.

This past weekend, I took it through some seriously challenging terrain near Glencoe that would have stopped my old Land Rover Defender in its tracks. The Avalanche XTR handled everything I threw at it with remarkable composure. The way it climbed over rocky sections while maintaining incredible stability was nothing short of impressive.

The engineering team deserves massive praise for creating such a phenomenal machine. Every detail shows thoughtful design and premium quality. I've been driving off-road vehicles for over 20 years, and this is truly in a class of its own.

My friends at the local 4x4 club are amazed by its capabilities, and I've already convinced two of them to book test drives at your Glasgow dealership. The Avalanche XTR isn't just meeting my expectations – it's completely exceeding them.

Thank you for building such an extraordinary vehicle. I'm looking forward to many more adventures in my Avalanche XTR!

Dear SnowMobile Customer Relations,

I'm writing to express my disappointment with the fuel economy of my 2024 Polar 4x4, which I purchased last June. As someone who has been a loyal SnowMobile customer, I expected better performance from your vehicles.

The fuel consumption is significantly higher than advertised, and I'm finding myself filling up the tank far more frequently than I should need to. I'm currently getting about 25% less mileage per tank than what was promised during the purchase process.

For comparison, my colleague's Kia Sportage, which is a similar size vehicle, is achieving much better fuel efficiency. This is particularly frustrating given the current fuel prices here in Scotland.

I've maintained the vehicle according to schedule and followed all recommended guidelines, but the fuel economy hasn't improved at all over the past ten months.

While I still appreciate many aspects of the Polar 4x4, this issue has definitely impacted my overall satisfaction with the vehicle.

I'm writing regarding serious transmission issues with my 2023 Blizzard SUV that I purchased just 5 months ago from your dealership. The transmission has started slipping severely, especially when accelerating from a stop. This is completely unacceptable for a vehicle this new.

I need this addressed immediately as the vehicle is my primary mode of transportation for work. When can I get this looked at? The issue seems to be getting worse by the day, and I'm concerned about potential safety implications.

Can you please tell me what the timeline would be for diagnosing and repairing this issue? I've already had to cancel several important meetings due to this problem.

Regards,
Daniel Morgan

Dear SnowMobile Team,

I just had to write to tell you about my wonderful experience at your Manchester dealership. As a proud owner of a 2024 Glacier Sedan, I've been consistently impressed with your company, but yesterday's service appointment truly exceeded my expectations.

From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel like a valued customer. James, my service advisor, remembered me from my purchase last month and even asked how I was enjoying the heated steering wheel feature he'd demonstrated during my initial purchase.

The service team was incredibly efficient, and they even offered me a complimentary valet service while they performed the scheduled maintenance. The waiting area was immaculate, and Sarah from the reception area kept checking if I needed anything while I worked from the comfortable customer lounge.

I particularly appreciated how the team took the time to explain everything they did during the service check. They even showed me some features of my Glacier that I hadn't discovered yet! The attention to detail and personal touch really made my day.

The dealership looks fantastic after the recent renovation, by the way. The new digital display wall showing all the latest SnowMobile models is quite impressive.

I just wanted to share this positive feedback because exceptional service deserves recognition. You've certainly earned a loyal customer, and I've already recommended SnowMobile to several of my colleagues.

Dear SnowMobile Team,

I hope this email finds you well. I'm Joseph Allen, Fleet Manager for Cardiff Distribution Ltd. in Wales. We're currently exploring options to upgrade our delivery fleet, and I'm particularly interested in SnowMobile's commercial lineup after seeing how they compare to our current Ford vehicles.

Could you provide detailed information on your available commercial models and their specifications? We're looking to potentially purchase 15-20 vehicles over the next quarter. I'd specifically like to know:

1. What fleet discount programs do you offer for bulk purchases?
2. Which of your models would you recommend for daily urban delivery operations?
3. What are your current lead times for bulk orders?
4. Do you offer any corporate maintenance packages?

Our budget is approximately £450,000 for this initiative, and I'd appreciate understanding how SnowMobile could accommodate this investment.

Would it be possible to arrange a meeting to discuss this opportunity in more detail? I'll be available next week for an in-person presentation at your convenience.

My friend's Honda Civic doesn't have any of these problems, and it's significantly older than my car.
