Hello SnowMobile team,

I've been looking at your Frostbite EV model and comparing it with Tesla's offerings. I'm quite interested but have some questions about the tax incentives and financing options available.

I understand there are OZEV grants available, but I'm a bit confused about how these work with your financing packages. Could you explain how these credits would be applied to the purchase price? Also, what documentation would I need to provide to qualify?

I'm based in the Midlands region and wondering if there are any additional local incentives I should be aware of. The Tesla dealer mentioned something about this, but I'd prefer to go with the Frostbite if the numbers work out.

Looking forward to your response,
Theo Jenkins

Dear Theo,

Thank you for your interest in the Frostbite EV. I'd be happy to clarify the tax incentive structure for you.

The OZEV grant currently provides £2,500 off the purchase price, which is automatically deducted at the point of sale. For financing, we can apply this reduction before calculating your monthly payments. You'll just need to provide proof of address and complete a simple eligibility form which we can help you with.

In the Midlands region, you're also eligible for an additional £500 local green vehicle incentive when financing through our preferred partners. I'd be happy to schedule a call to walk you through the complete breakdown of available incentives and our competitive financing rates.

Would you be available for a brief call tomorrow to discuss this in more detail?

From: George Clarke <georgeclarke@email.com>
To: Customer Service <support@snowmobile.com>
Date: April 13, 2025 11:42:22 GMT

Dear SnowMobile Support,

I am writing to express my extreme disappointment regarding the exterior finish of my 2023 Polar 4x4, which I purchased just last January. The paint on the roof has started peeling significantly, exposing the bare metal underneath. This is completely unacceptable for a vehicle that's barely 15 months old.

I've been a loyal SnowMobile customer and specifically chose the Polar 4x4 for its supposed premium quality and durability. To see the paint deteriorating so quickly in our Northern Ireland weather is deeply concerning. The peeling is particularly noticeable along the front section of the roof and is spreading towards the middle.

I have two urgent questions:
1. Is this issue covered under the vehicle's warranty?
2. How quickly can someone inspect the vehicle to assess the damage?

This kind of quality issue seriously makes me question the build standards of SnowMobile vehicles. I need this addressed as soon as possible before the exposed metal begins to rust and creates an even bigger problem.

Please respond with available appointment times for an inspection. I expect this to be treated as a priority given the potential for further damage.

Regards,
George Clarke

Thank you for reaching out about your Frostbite EV's range concerns. I understand how frustrating it can be when your vehicle isn't meeting expectations, especially regarding battery performance.

Dear SnowMobile Service Team,

I'm writing with serious concerns about my 2023 Blizzard SUV that I purchased last July. During the recent heavy rains here in Wales, I've discovered that water is leaking through the sunroof and causing damage to my interior. The water is dripping directly onto the front seats and center console, and I'm worried about potential electrical issues.

This is particularly frustrating as the vehicle is less than a year old. When will someone be able to look at this? I need this addressed quickly before the next rainfall causes more damage.

Can you please advise on the earliest possible appointment? Also, what should I do to protect the interior in the meantime?

Dear Ms. Harrison,

Thank you for bringing this concerning issue to our attention regarding your 2023 Blizzard SUV. We understand how worrying a sunroof leak can be, especially given the weather conditions in Wales.

We can schedule an immediate inspection of your vehicle's sunroof seal system. Our nearest service center in Wales has an emergency appointment available tomorrow at 9:00 AM or 2:00 PM. Until then, we recommend placing towels on the affected areas and, if possible, parking your vehicle in a covered area.

These types of leaks typically require a thorough inspection of the sunroof drainage system and seals, which we'll prioritize given the risk of interior damage.

Please let us know which appointment time works best for you, and we'll confirm it immediately.

The sales team, particularly James Morton, went above and beyond during my recent maintenance visit. Not only did they complete the scheduled service efficiently, but they also took the time to show me some new features I hadn't discovered yet on my Avalanche XTR.

The dealership's attention to detail and personal touch really stood out. They remembered my preferences from my purchase last September and even had my favorite coffee waiting in the customer lounge. These small gestures truly make a difference and remind me why I chose SnowMobile in the first place.

I especially appreciated how the team took the time to walk me through everything they did during the service, ensuring I understood each step. The facility was immaculate, and the entire process was smooth and professional.

Just wanted to express my gratitude for maintaining such high standards of customer service. It's refreshing to see a company that values its customers even after the sale is complete.

Dear SnowMobile Service Team,

I'm writing about my 2021 Blizzard SUV, which I purchased from your Edinburgh dealership in August 2021. I'm experiencing significant issues with the air conditioning system that are making my daily commute quite uncomfortable in our unseasonably warm Scottish spring.

The AC is barely producing any cold air, even when set to the lowest temperature setting. When I turn it on, I can hear the system running, but the air coming through the vents remains lukewarm at best. This started happening about three days ago, and I'm concerned it might be a serious issue.

Could you please advise on two things:
1. How soon can I get my vehicle inspected at your service center?
2. What would be a rough estimate for this type of repair?

I rely heavily on my vehicle for work, so I'm hoping this can be addressed promptly.

Hello SnowMobile Support,

I'm having significant trouble with the roof rack system I purchased for my 2024 Polar 4x4. I've been trying to install it for the past two hours, and something just isn't right. The mounting brackets don't seem to align properly with the roof rails, and I'm worried about damaging either the rack or my vehicle.

I've followed the instruction manual step by step, but there seems to be a gap between the mounting points and the rails that shouldn't be there. Is this normal? The whole system feels loose, which can't be safe for carrying equipment.

Could someone please help me understand what I might be doing wrong? I really need this rack installed before my upcoming trip next weekend. Also, is it possible to schedule an inspection at your service center to ensure it's installed correctly?

I purchased this directly from your dealership in January when I bought my Polar 4x4, and this is the first time I've tried to install it. The quality of the rack itself seems fine, but this installation process is incredibly frustrating.

Looking forward to your guidance on this matter.

Subject: Excessive oil consumption

Dear SnowMobile Service Team,

I am writing with increasing frustration regarding the ongoing oil consumption issue with my 2022 Tundra Truck, which I purchased from your Belfast dealership last June. This is now the fourth time I'm having to raise this concern, and quite frankly, I'm at my wit's end.

My truck is consuming oil at an alarming rate - nearly 1 litre every 1,000 kilometers. This is absolutely unacceptable for a vehicle that's less than three years old. I've been monitoring this closely since January, and the problem is only getting worse. My brother-in-law, who owns a Ford Ranger, doesn't have to deal with anything like this.

I've already brought this to your attention multiple times over the past few months, but the ""top-ups"" your service department keeps recommending aren't addressing the underlying issue. When I purchased this vehicle, I was assured of its reliability and performance.

Two questions I need answered:
1. When can you perform a proper oil consumption test?
2. What will be done to permanently resolve this issue?

I need this addressed urgently as I rely on this vehicle for my daily work commute. If this continues, I'll have no choice but to explore other options, including legal ones.

Please respond with a concrete action plan.

Regards,
Emma Robinson

Also, could you let me know roughly how long a typical VR session takes? I want to ensure I set aside enough time to properly explore all the options.

Looking forward to this incredible virtual experience!

Dear Sophie,

Thank you for contacting SnowMobile regarding your key fob battery replacement inquiry.

The 2021 Glacier Sedan key fob uses a CR2032 3V lithium battery, which is commonly available at most electronics stores or pharmacies. To replace the battery, gently separate the key fob using the small notch on the side, remove the old battery, and insert the new one with the positive (+) side facing up.

If you need any additional assistance with the replacement process, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

Dear SnowMobile Support Team,

I'm writing regarding ongoing issues with the driver assist system in my 2024 Frostbite EV, which I purchased just two months ago. The calibration seems to be completely off, and I'm experiencing concerning behavior that's making me question my decision to choose SnowMobile over a Tesla Model Y.

The system has been behaving erratically during my daily commute through Edinburgh. It frequently misidentifies lane markings and occasionally attempts to steer unnecessarily, which is frankly terrifying on our Scottish roads. This morning, it nearly steered me into a kerb while attempting to navigate a roundabout.

Could you please explain:
1. What exactly is involved in the recalibration process?
2. How long will I need to leave my vehicle at the service center?

I've invested significantly in this vehicle, and this type of performance is unacceptable for a premium vehicle. I need this resolved as soon as possible as it's becoming a safety concern.

Dear SnowMobile Support,

I'm writing about an ongoing issue with my 2022 Blizzard SUV that I purchased from your Belfast dealership in November 2022. For the third time now, I'm experiencing an annoying rattling noise coming from the sunroof area. This started about two months ago, and despite two previous visits to your service center, the problem keeps coming back.

The rattling is most noticeable when driving over bumps or rough roads, and it's becoming increasingly frustrating. I've already had this looked at twice, but whatever fix was applied clearly isn't working long-term.

Could you please advise what can be done to resolve this permanently? I'd like to schedule another inspection, but I want assurance that this time it will be properly diagnosed and fixed.

Dear SnowMobile Service Team,

I'm writing regarding a serious issue with my 2023 Polar 4x4 that I purchased from your Cardiff dealership last August. The windshield wiper system has completely failed during some particularly wet weather we're having in Wales, which as you can imagine, is creating a very dangerous situation.

The wipers started making an unusual grinding noise yesterday, and this morning they stopped working altogether. The motor seems to be completely dead - there's no response when I use the wiper controls, not even a sound. This is especially concerning as I rely on this vehicle for my daily commute through rural areas.

Could you please advise on two things:
1. How quickly can you get me in for an emergency repair?
2. What would be the estimated cost for this type of repair?

I've had the vehicle for less than a year, and I'm quite disappointed to be experiencing such a significant issue already. I need this resolved as soon as possible given the safety implications of driving without functioning wipers in Welsh weather.

I'm writing with growing concern about my 2021 Tundra Truck that I purchased from your London dealership in December 2021. Over the past week, I've been experiencing a very frustrating issue with the battery completely draining overnight, even when the vehicle isn't in use.

This morning, for the third time this week, I couldn't start my truck to get to work. Each time, I've had to call my neighbor to help jump-start the vehicle. I'm worried there might be a serious underlying electrical problem that needs to be addressed.

Could you please explain what your diagnostic process involves for electrical issues like this? Also, how soon could I bring the vehicle in for inspection? I rely heavily on my truck for work, and I can't afford to keep dealing with unexpected battery failures.

Dear SnowMobile team,

I just had to write to you after watching several YouTube reviews of my Frostbite EV this morning. As a proud owner for the past month, it's fantastic to see the automotive community giving the vehicle the recognition it deserves. The comparisons with the Tesla Model 3 are particularly satisfying - especially seeing how the reviewers are highlighting the superior build quality of the Frostbite.

I've owned my Frostbite EV since March 7th, and the experience has been nothing short of exceptional. Living here in Wales, I was initially concerned about EV performance in our challenging weather, but the Frostbite has exceeded all expectations. The positive media coverage really validates my choice.

Just wanted to share my excitement with you. It's great to be part of the SnowMobile family and to see the brand getting such positive attention in the press.

Dear SnowMobile Service Team,

I'm writing about an issue with the rear window defogger in my 2021 Blizzard SUV. I purchased the vehicle from your Belfast dealership in July 2021, and this is the first problem I've encountered with it.

The defogger has stopped working completely over the past week. With the weather we're having in Northern Ireland, this is becoming quite frustrating as I can't properly clear my rear window during morning commutes. I've checked the fuse and it appears to be fine, so I'm not sure what's causing the problem.

Could you please advise what might be causing this issue? Also, what would be the process for getting this checked and repaired?

I would appreciate a response at your earliest convenience.

Date: April 18, 2025, 18:17:54

Dear SnowMobile Support,

I'm writing regarding an ongoing issue with the auto-parking system in my 2023 Frostbite EV. I purchased the vehicle last February, and until now, it's been relatively reliable. However, the parking assist feature has started acting erratically over the past week.

When I attempt to use the auto-parking function, the system either fails to initiate or stops mid-process. This is particularly frustrating as I specifically chose this model over a Tesla for its advanced parking capabilities. I live in a busy area of Cardiff, and reliable parking assistance is essential for my daily routine.

The system displays a ""Parking Assist Unavailable"" message, but there's no explanation of why. I've already tried resetting the system multiple times as suggested in the manual, but the problem persists.

Could you please advise on how to resolve this issue? I'd appreciate if you could schedule a diagnostic check at your earliest convenience.

Best regards,
Isla Lewis

I am absolutely FURIOUS with this ongoing issue! This is now the FIFTH time I'm writing about the infotainment system in my 2022 Glacier Sedan completely freezing up. I purchased this vehicle in September 2022, and I've been dealing with this nightmare ever since.

The touchscreen keeps freezing at the most inconvenient times - just yesterday, I was trying to navigate to an important meeting in Cardiff, and the entire system locked up. I couldn't access navigation, climate controls, or even the radio! I had to pull over and restart the car THREE times just to get it working again.

Your service center in Wales has been absolutely useless in resolving this. Every time I bring it in, they do a ""system reset"" and tell me it's fixed, but the problem keeps coming back. I'm tired of hearing that ""it's a known issue"" and ""engineering is working on it."" When will there actually be a permanent solution?

I need to know EXACTLY when this will be fixed. I paid good money for what was supposed to be a premium vehicle, and this is completely unacceptable. How much longer am I expected to deal with this?

Dear SnowMobile Team,

I simply had to write to tell you how absolutely thrilled I am with my new Avalanche XTR. After three months of ownership here in the Scottish Highlands, I can confidently say this is the most capable vehicle I've ever owned.

This past weekend, I took it through some seriously challenging terrain near Glencoe that would have stopped my old Land Rover Defender in its tracks. The Avalanche XTR handled everything I threw at it with remarkable composure. The way it climbed over rocky sections while maintaining incredible stability was nothing short of impressive.

The engineering team deserves massive praise for creating such a phenomenal machine. Every detail shows thoughtful design and premium quality. I've been driving off-road vehicles for over 20 years, and this is truly in a class of its own.

My friends at the local 4x4 club are amazed by its capabilities, and I've already convinced two of them to book test drives at your Glasgow dealership. The Avalanche XTR isn't just meeting my expectations – it's completely exceeding them.

Thank you for building such an extraordinary vehicle. I'm looking forward to many more adventures in my Avalanche XTR!

Hi SnowMobile team,

I'm considering trading in my 2019 Glacier Sedan for a newer model. I've had it since March 2019, and while it's served me well, I'm looking to upgrade. I've been comparing options, including the Toyota Corolla, but I'd prefer to stick with SnowMobile if the numbers work out.

The fuel economy on my current Glacier has been great, and I'm hoping the newer models are even better. Could you let me know what kind of trade-in value I might get for my current vehicle? It's in good condition with regular maintenance.

I'm based in London and can bring it in for an assessment at your convenience.

Best regards,
Harry Mitchell

I'm writing with increasing concern about my 2022 Polar 4x4. The engine noise I reported during my last service visit in February has become significantly worse. The knocking sound is now much louder, especially when accelerating, and it's really worrying me. This is the third time I've had to raise this issue since purchasing the vehicle in July 2022.

I've been a loyal SnowMobile customer, but I'm starting to regret not going with the Ford Ranger my brother recommended. The persistent engine problems are making me lose confidence in the vehicle's reliability.

Subject: Disappointed with fuel economy

Dear SnowMobile Customer Relations,

I'm writing to express my disappointment with the fuel economy of my 2024 Polar 4x4, which I purchased last June. As someone who has been a loyal SnowMobile customer, I expected better performance from your vehicles.

The fuel consumption is significantly higher than advertised, and I'm finding myself filling up the tank far more frequently than I should need to. I'm currently getting about 25% less mileage per tank than what was promised during the purchase process.

For comparison, my colleague's Kia Sportage, which is a similar size vehicle, is achieving much better fuel efficiency. This is particularly frustrating given the current fuel prices here in Scotland.

I've maintained the vehicle according to schedule and followed all recommended guidelines, but the fuel economy hasn't improved at all over the past ten months.

While I still appreciate many aspects of the Polar 4x4, this issue has definitely impacted my overall satisfaction with the vehicle.

From the moment I arrived, the staff made me feel like a valued customer. James, my service advisor, remembered me from my purchase last month and even asked how I was enjoying the heated steering wheel feature he'd demonstrated during my initial purchase.

The service team was incredibly efficient, and they even offered me a complimentary valet service while they performed the scheduled maintenance. The waiting area was immaculate, and Sarah from the reception area kept checking if I needed anything while I worked from the comfortable customer lounge.

I particularly appreciated how the team took the time to explain everything they did during the service check. They even showed me some features of my Glacier that I hadn't discovered yet! The attention to detail and personal touch really made my day.

The dealership looks fantastic after the recent renovation, by the way. The new digital display wall showing all the latest SnowMobile models is quite impressive.

Hello SnowMobile Support,

I'm writing about ongoing Bluetooth connectivity problems with my 2021 Polar 4x4's infotainment system. This is the third time I've had this issue since purchasing the vehicle, and frankly, it's becoming quite frustrating.

The system keeps disconnecting from my phone during calls and music playback. Sometimes it won't reconnect unless I restart the entire vehicle, which is really inconvenient, especially when I'm trying to use navigation or take important calls while driving around Edinburgh.

I've already tried deleting and re-pairing my phone, but the problem persists. Could you please provide detailed troubleshooting steps? Also, is this a known issue with the 2021 Polar 4x4 model?

I'm writing again about the persistent rattling noise coming from my dashboard in my 2023 Glacier Sedan. This is now the third time I've had to contact you about this issue since I purchased the vehicle last June, and frankly, I'm getting quite frustrated.

The rattling starts every time I drive over even slightly uneven roads, and it's becoming unbearable. I've had two previous appointments at your service center, but the problem keeps returning within weeks. This kind of interior quality issue is completely unacceptable for a vehicle at this price point. My friend's Honda Civic doesn't have any of these problems, and it's significantly older than my car.

What options do I have to get this fixed permanently? The temporary fixes clearly aren't working, and I'm tired of making repeated trips to your service center.

Can you please advise on next steps?

Hello SnowMobile team,

I've been comparing various EVs in the market, and I'm particularly interested in your Frostbite EV model. I was previously looking at Tesla, but your specs caught my attention.

I have a few questions about the tax incentives and financing options. I understand there are OZEV grants available, but I'm a bit confused about how these would apply to my purchase:

1. Would I be eligible for the full tax credit if I finance through SnowMobile?
2. How does the credit application process work - is it applied at purchase or during tax filing?
3. Can you explain how your financing rates compare to current market rates?

I'm based in the Midlands region and looking to make a decision in the next few weeks.

Best regards,
Theo Jenkins

I'll be happy to walk you through the OZEV grant process and our financing options. Would you be available for a quick call tomorrow to discuss your specific situation? This would allow me to provide personalized information based on your circumstances.
